# terminal based stopwatch

This is a simple ncurses based stopwatch. Many of stopwatches in MacOS are paid.
I wanted to have a simple stopwatch that just works and does not take more CPU.

Here it is!

## compile

```
$ ./configure
$ make
$ ./stopwatch
```
## usage

Press p or spacebar to pause the timer
Press Esc to exit
